# Reddit-Flair-Detection

In this repository, I have developed a model to detect flairs of India subreddit posts using Machine Learning algorithms. 

**Structure**
1. [Reddit_data_collection](https://github.com/somya22/Reddit-Flair-Detection/blob/master/Reddit_data_collection.ipynb) Notebook contains all the code that was used to fetch data using PRAW API from reddit and merging it with the dataset downloaded from Kaggle. It was then cleaned and saved into a CSV file to do the data analysis and build the machine learning model.
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/somya22/Reddit-Flair-Detection/blob/master/EDA.ipynb) Notebook contains all the code that was used to analyse and visualize the data.
3. [Preprocessing](https://github.com/somya22/Reddit-Flair-Detection/blob/master/preprocessing.py) file cntains all the code required to preprocess and clean the data.
4. [Flair-Detector](https://github.com/somya22/Reddit-Flair-Detection/blob/master/Flair_Detector.ipynb) Notebook contains the code used to train various machine learning models and check the accuracy on different features.
